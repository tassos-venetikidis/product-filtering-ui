# Product Filtering UI

Minimalistic UI that demonstrates filtering capabilities along two different lines. The displayed products can be filtered according to their name, based on the search term that the user inputs. Furthermore, products can be filtered based on their corresponding category, when toggled on the categories checkboxes. Filtering can be further customized when combining both approaches to filter out products of specific categories according to name.

- Style furnished with the usage of TailwindCSS
- Functionality implemented using only vanilla JavaScript
